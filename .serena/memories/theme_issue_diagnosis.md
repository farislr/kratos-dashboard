# Theme Switcher Root Cause Analysis - SOLVED!

## Live Testing Results with Playwright

### ✅ JavaScript Logic Working Perfectly:
- HTML class changes: `light` → `dark` ✅  
- Button title updates: "Switch to dark mode" → "Switch to light mode" ✅
- localStorage saves theme: `theme: "dark"` ✅
- Button shows [active] state ✅

### ❌ CSS Not Applying - Root Cause Found:
**Problem**: Elements have `dark:bg-gray-800` classes but computed styles show `rgb(255, 255, 255)` (white)

**Evidence from Live Test**:
```
htmlClass: "dark"  ← HTML class is correct
computedBg: "rgb(255, 255, 255)"  ← BUT computed style is still white!
classList: "bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 ..."  ← Classes are present
```

## Root Cause Identified:
**Tailwind CSS dark mode classes are not being applied despite HTML having `dark` class.**

This indicates either:
1. CSS compilation issue with Tailwind 4.x
2. CSS specificity problem 
3. PostCSS/build configuration issue
4. Turbopack CSS processing problem

## Next Steps:
1. Check Tailwind CSS compilation
2. Verify PostCSS configuration  
3. Test with fresh build
4. Consider Tailwind CSS debugging
